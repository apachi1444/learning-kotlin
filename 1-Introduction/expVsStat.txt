an expression is a word or group of words or symbols
that is a value

an expression in programming is a value or something 
that returns a value or anything that executes and ends up
being a value

a statement is a group of expressions
they either do tasks or don't do them
any statement that can return a value is automatically 
qualified to be used as an expression

let amount = $2000
compilers and interpreters don't execute any standalone expression

add(2,3) -> is a statement
but const result = add(2,3) is an expression

- some programmers avoid if statements by using the ternary operator 
to avoid side effects !

side effect is : modifying some state variable value outside its local environment
or we can say uses or changes stuff outside its scope

that s why people prefer writing pure functions ( functions without side effects )
In a nutshell, a function is said to have side effects when it depends on or modifies 
a state outside its scope
