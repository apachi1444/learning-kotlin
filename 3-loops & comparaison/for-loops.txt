whatever we need to loop over
needs an items called "iterator" : 
it's all about a piece of code that gives us 
each element one by one

for ( name in names ) println(name)
for ( i in 1..10 ) println(i)
// 1 .. 10 is IntRange which has an iterator
// 1 and 10 are included

for ( i in 1 until 10 ) println(i)
// 10 is not included

for ( i in 10 downTo 1 ) println(i)
// all numbers are included

for ( i in 1..10 step 2) println(i)
// or we can type directly 1.inRange(10).step(2)

for ( i in names.indices) println("$names[i] has the value of $i")
