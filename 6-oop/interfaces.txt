if we have interface 

and a class which implements the interface
we can make it abstract to avoid implements methods

override fun .... 
class ClassImplementation : NameInterface , AnotherInterface

- interfaces : can have default implementation
- and we can of course override these default methods !
- but property initializer in interface is not allowed !
we cannot do val string : String = "String"

- but we must do val string : String
- and then in the implementation we must do

- override val string : String
                get() = "my new String in class implementation"

- object is nameClass | object instance of nameClass in JAVA
