offer an easy way to handle classes whose main purpose is to hold data.
They include behavior that we often need when handling data withou the need to explicity write the extra logic.

Compiler auto generates toString ( form User(name  = Yessine , age = 42 ) ) , equals and hashCode
when you add some properties to the constructor it will add it automatically to the code
- at least one parameter in the primary constructor and need to be noted with “val” or “var”
( just a remark we use the val or var to indicate to the
- we cannot do vararg parameter in the constructor !
- data classes cannot inherit from other data classes !
- copy() function
- componentN() functions corresponding to the properties in their order of declaration
