in kotlin , classes / methods / properties are public by default !

- internal : public in the same module
- private : 
- protected 

public var bar : Int = 5
    private set

in Kotlin , outer class does not see private members of 
its inner classes !

open class Outer {
    private val a = 1
    protected open val b = 2
    internal open val c = 3
    val d = 4  // public by default

    protected class Nested {
        public val e: Int = 5
    }
}

class Subclass : Outer() {
    // a is not visible
    // b, c and d are visible
    // Nested and e are visible

    override val b = 5   // 'b' is protected
    override val c = 7   // 'c' is internal
}

class Unrelated(o: Outer) {
    // o.a, o.b are not visible
    // o.c and o.d are visible (same module)
    // Outer.Nested is not visible, and Nested::e is not visible either
}

- about constructor always public by default
class C private constructor (a : Int){}
