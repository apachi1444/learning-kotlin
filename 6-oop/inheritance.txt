- classes in kotlin are by default closed to inheritance
- to make them open to inheritance we should add "open"
open class

in the mother class 
for example we have 

// we cannot access it outside both classes !
protected open val sessionId = "hahah"


class ChildClass : MotherClass(){
    override val providerInfo : String
        get() = super.providerInfo
        // or 
        get() = "new value of the provider Info"
}
