In java , when we override the method equals it will obviously check the memory location
even if do the equals method we have to call it explicitly

â†’ then comes Kotlin for solving this issue of overriding the operator equals
override operator fun equals
then in the main function
when we do obj1==obj2 it will compare depending on the logic that we did in the override method !

But if the user want to check for true object equality
this is where === comes into play
to check the memory location
