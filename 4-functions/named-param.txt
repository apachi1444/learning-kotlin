when we use the default param in our function we can 
sometimes want to change only the second parameter
but how we gonna tell the compiler we need to pass
only the second argument not the first argument

-> we must use the named parameter in our function
// reps in this case is the second argument
// tell the compiler which parameter we need to change 
greet(reps = 5)

// we can pass unnamed arguments before named ones
// we can also name all our arguments

// suppose that we have the greet function which got as
// parameters 3 ones !
greet(message = "" , name = "" , reps = 5)
