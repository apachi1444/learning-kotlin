why we ues the inline
to avoid the waste of time if we call the function and execute a lot of times

- when we have an inline function :
the code of function is copied and pasted to call point
the process if faster but it could lead to more memory usage

- inline can also be used with HOF

inline fun repeat(times: Int, action: () -> Unit) {
    for (i in 0 until times) {
        action()
    }
}

fun main() {
    repeat(5) {
        println("Hello, World!")
    }

allows the JVM to copy the repeat function code to the call site and
eliminates the overhead of function call.

when to use this kind of functions :

* When a function is called frequently and performance is a concern
* When a function has a small and simple body
