when we use the const val in our program
we create the compile time constant
to tell the compiler that this variable is not meant to be
changed
- also tell the compiler that whenever you see this variable
you must insert the value directly in the variable

- we cannot create const val inside a function because functions
are executed when the program is running !

- not const var ofc !

- public static final String in JAVA

- we can use the const val with String and the primitive types !
