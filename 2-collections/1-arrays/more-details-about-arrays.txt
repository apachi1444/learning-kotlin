- sequential fixed-size memory region
- is mutable ( can be changed through any reference to it)
( we can change the content of their items )
- has fixed size and cannot expand or shrink
- arrays are optimized for primitive types
( IntArray , DoubleArray .. )
which are mapped to java primitive arrays ( int[] )
 ! but boxed ones ( Array<Int> mapped to Java's Integer[] )
- arrays are invariant on T ( Array<Int> is not Array<Number>)
( same for mutableList)
